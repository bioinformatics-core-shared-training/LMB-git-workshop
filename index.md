### Github Web-pages
[Practical - live-coding session using Markdown](https://mfernandes61.github.io/github_web_course/).  
* Using Markdown to create a Github Page (practical - live-code a Page).  
* Using Markdown to create a Github Wiki (Practical - live-code a Wiki).  

### Creating good READMEs
* What makes a good README? (Discussion).  
- (practical/discussion) Take an [example](https://github.com/php-censor/php-censor ) and go through it.    
   * What do you like?   
   * what do you not like?   
_Further examples and reading_.

### Issue tracking and continuous integration.  
* [Issue Tracking](issue-tracking.html) – GH helping you manage bugs (AP)
* [Demo - continuous integration](https://github.com/pajanne/simple-py-ci) - GH and Travis helping you test your code continuously

### Licencing.  
- Why do we licence?   
- Who are we licencing to?    
   - Treefinder: Example of licence restriction based on [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treefinder#Controversy).   
* Couple of exercises:    
       • Whiteboard brainstorming exercise – what software licences have you heard of or come across?   
       • Allocate a licence to groups and get them to find a copy of it. Quick (3 min presentation of why
it would/would not meet the needs of their software project)- (Ditch this one if time is short).  

[Slides used from SoftwareSaved](https://softwaresaved.github.io/software-licensing-workshop/#/).  
• Practical - take a Flashcard. Look at the scenario printed on it - in your group discuss and decide upon
which if any licence is best. (Quick report back if time}.
